Dear Reviewer

I  use "download.file(url, zip_file, method="curl")" to download ziped data file
from internet. As you know, download is a computer & OS specific function and it 
may also can be affected by network. In case of problem of download, I put data 
file "data.zip" in the repository. If you have any problem about downloading. 
Please just comment the code as bellow in every R script.

# download.file(url, zip_file, method="curl")

Thanks very much :)
